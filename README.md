PairRateHandler
===============

I created this library for use in .NET programs to handle Foreign Exchange pairs and rates.

Some common issues in FX revolve around using the correct convention of a pair, getting the rate in the correct convention
and being able to create rates between cross currencies.  I wanted to create a library that could support all those annoying thing
and then some for my own personal use.
